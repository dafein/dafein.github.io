<p>I want to use this format to clearly convey the main points of the Gyrotonic movement system, which is a movement art and rehabilitative movement system popoular with dancers, physical therapists, and is growing as an alternative to pilates and yoga for the general public.  I am trained in the system and know most of the teachers in the islands, and know some of the people who are involved with the system on the mainland, where the promotion and use of the brand are regulated in order to maintain fidelity to the originators ideas.  I would like the site to be an introduction to the Gyrotonic system, focusing on the uses of the system and specific details about a studio here in Honolulu.  This would include a map and contact form.  The first section would include imagery and a basic explanation of the system.  General terms and a tag line, something like expand yourself!, and pose a question, such as, have you ever wondered if there is an exercise system that truly incorporates the principles of martial arts and yoga?  This will be the problem that this website is trying to solve, which is the lack of rehabilitative movment systems that are gentle and healing, while having endless potential for increasing athletic performance.  This is where the question of audience comes up.  Am I aiming this site at complete novices to the movement art world, or is it aimed at people who have tried many systems and are looking for a unique movement art that really applies the principles in TCM, yoga, and martial arts, which are underlying a lot of the holistic movement systems, but are not necessarily expressed in the system.  That is the problemthat this site is trying to solve.  The site will also be trying to convince people to come to the studio, and/or fill in the contact form, in order to find new clients for a revenue stream. </p>
