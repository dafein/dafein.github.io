That and cooking in poly-unsaturated vegetable oils.  I only wonder how long it will take before this knowledge finally becomes non-controversial and mainstream?","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"I've explained it this way: Some cancers are Fords or Chevys. There are lots of them. You can take your Ford to the corner mechanic. RCC is rare and different, like a Ferrari. The corner mechanic is not used to working with a Ferrari. You take it to a specialist.","attribution":"member, Smart Patients Team"},{"snippet":"Also, cancer is(at least in the case of a blood cancer such as POEMS) an immune response issue.  Typically cancer cells(which tend to be created often, are usually readily identified and killed by other appropriate blood cells.    When they are not identified it is because they have developed a capability to appear as normal blood cells to the rest of the blood cell community - and one current theory is that they have assumed(or developed) a messaging capability that tells other blood cells they are not a cancer cell - so the killer cells leave them alone and they(the cancer cells) can continue to proliferorate.","attribution":"member, POEMS Syndrome"},{"snippet":"Recently a member of the MM Community had SCT.  He is a regular poster and when I had not heard from him in two weeks I began to worry.\r\n\r\nI was hoping that he and other members of the MM Community to give a \"daily\" summary of what they went through, starting with the day they entered the hospital for the SCT.  This way other folks who might be getting SCT would know what to expect as well as loved one and caretakers.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"A relationship with your oncologist is different than with someone you will see only a few times in your life.  I see my oncologist every other week.  I have to call his staff about once a week.  I refuse to see anyone that upsets me, does not listen to me, does not explain things to me.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"I've had the the DNR No Code status since I was 58 years old. My decision came after watching an actual \"resuscitation\" of a friend who had a sudden cardiac arrest at the age of 55.","attribution":"member, Breast Cancer"},{"snippet":"Our medical professionals have a lot on their plates and access to a forum where they will hear the patients' side of things can only be beneficial to everyone.\r\n\r\nI also appreciate the fact that this will be separate from the patient site. Patients do need a place to vent where they can feel secure and respected. They also need to swap impressions and  information in a secure forum.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"  I only base my decisions on SBM - science based medicine.  As far as I am concerned Essiac Tea has been shown to be worthless if not downright quackery.  Similarly, there still remains no credible scientific proof that intravenous High Dose Vitamin C is efficacious.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"A good health profile popup is a great help to other members so they can give you good answers.  It also helps other members put your own comments into perspective.","attribution":"member, Esophageal Cancer"},{"snippet":"Having a supportive family is very important, but having a supportive  e-family that understands all the ins and outs of rcc and the trials and tribulations of being a caregiver AND can offer truly helpful advice and opinions is even more important!","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"I hate that I have cancer and have endured a lot to still be here today. I'm proud to have found peace through acceptance. I'm pretty sure that being at war for the last 7.5 years would have driven me crazy. I'm just hoping that by making peace with my body, it will one day reward me and decide to eliminate my cancer.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"Oncologists treat cancer, Palliative Care specialists treat the side effects of the disease and the treatment.","attribution":"member, Lung Cancer"},{"snippet":"One of the aspects of SP that I really like is the thoughtfulness of responses that are given when questions are asked. I ditched all of the other cancer websites I tried because SP is the one that meets my personal needs.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"Smart patients is my first stop in the morning and my last in the evening.  I am a better caregiver because of you.  SP also has given me personally the strength that I need.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"},{"snippet":"When you go to the oncologist I suggest that you take someone with you, ask them to write notes about the things you are told. Write down your questions ahead of time, and don't be shy about asking the doctor or other medical professionals to explain things. The language is new and confusing, it takes us all a while to understand what is going on.","attribution":"member, Kidney Cancer"}]};</script>

                            <p>The word qigong has often been translated as "breathing exercises."  One of the ancient names for qigong, tu gu na xin, "expelling the old, drawing in the new," sounds like a modern description of the gaseous exchange that occurs during respiration.  The foundation of qigong breathing is shun hu xi, "natural respiration."  Shun actually means "free-flowing, going with nature's current."  It is the opposite of swimming upstream.  Learning the principles of qigong breathing lays the foundation for  healing.

                        <p>The Feldenkrais Method is based on principles of physics, biomechanics and an empirical understanding of learning and human development. By expanding the self-image through movement sequences that bring attention to the parts of the self that are out of awareness, the Method enables you to include more of yourself in your functioning movements. Students become more aware of their habitual neuromuscular patterns and rigidities and expand options for new ways of moving. By increasing sensitivity the Feldenkrais Method assists you to live your life more fully, efficiently and comfortably.</p>

					<p>The Gyrotonic method is an orginal, and unique movement practice which has roots in Yoga, Tai Chi, and dance. Gyrotonic exercise sequences are composed of spiraling, circular movements, which flow together seamlessly in rhythmic repetitions, with corresponding breath. WIth Gyrotonic exercises, each movement flows into the next, allowing the joints to move through a natural range of motion without jarring or compression. These carefully crafted sequences create balance, efficiency, strength and flexibility.</p>
