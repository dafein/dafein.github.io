<h2>ARE YOUR EXERCISES HELPING YOU REACH YOUR FULL POTENTIAL?</h2>
</header>

<ul>
<li>Every time exercising must be a new experience. Exercising is not a routine.</li>
<li>Physicality has its limits.  The experience of it is infinite/limitless.  In other words: the finite must reach and embrace the infinite.</li>
<li>Never compare with others or yesterday</li>
<li>Imagination is Quick.  The body follows slower.  Understanding the laws of physics, leverage, gravity and velocity in combination with the individual physical makeup is of critical importance.</li>
</ul>

<p class="ingredient"> The use of sage to combat excessive sweating (including clinical hyperhidrosis) has been an age-old traditional remedy.<strong> Sage works to calm the nerve fibers that produce sweat.</strong> The active compounds in sage have anti-bacterial, anti-fungal, and anti-hydrotic effects which all inhibit perspiration. <strong>When we combined sage with our other key proprietary ingredients the results were astounding.</strong> No other product on the market offers complete relief that only DermiDry can. </p>

			   <h5>Reason #1</h5>
	                    <p>Gyrotonic exercises are performed on custom-designed Gyrotonic equipment, whereas Gyrokinesis exercises are performed on a mat and chair. Both Gyrotonic and Gyrokinesis exercise sequences are composed of spiraling, circular movements, which flow together seamlessly in rhythmic repetitions, with corresponding breath. Each movement flows into the next, allowing the joints to move through a natural range of motion without jarring or compression. These carefully crafted sequences create balance, efficiency, strength and flexibility.
