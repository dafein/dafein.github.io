		<description><![CDATA[Ovarian cancer remains SO difficult to diagnosis . As a ten year survivor I still have nightmares about my  hospital stories associated with diagnosis.  But all stories are different . Now a five year breast cancer survivor as well- yes facing the second diagnosis was another story.  I love the tango story but was sad she didn&#039;t &quot;talk&quot; about her experience of hospice care &amp; preparing to die.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Mike, I&#039;m so sorry for your loss. We certainly didn&#039;t mean to suggest that everyone has the same story. Just the opposite: each story is unique and important and can teach us a huge amount. Our hope is to help people who want to share their stories to do so, so that more of us can learn from them.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Lucie, that&#039;s a fair perspective. Others had shared with us that they found it helpful and could identify with his struggle. In any case, we look forward to sharing Bonnie&#039;s story with you soon.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[While the story you have here above (of the woman with ovarian cancer and the red tango shoes) promises to be interesting and promising, the sample story you have on indiegogo is rather awful as a sample story. Sure, it&#039;s legitimate, it&#039;s someone story, but it is so atypical... It&#039;s more about someone who has not adjusted to the shock of what he went through, even though he is OK now...]]></description>
