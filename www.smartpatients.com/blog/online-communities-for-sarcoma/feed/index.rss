		<description><![CDATA[The Leiomyosarcoma group at ACOR played a front an center role of the early days of Gleevec for GIST.  The LMS group at ACOR was where a number of desperately ill GIST patients heard first word about the small breakthrough trial of STI-571 for GIST (which had until that trial been commonly referred to as GI LMS).   These GIST patients on ACOR&#039;s LMS group became many of the first GIST pts in the world to take STI-571 in what was called the B-2222 trial.  Without any doubt, ACOR&#039;s LMS group saved me from death.  GIST Support International today exists in the open model of ACOR of the late 1990&#039;s.  Our hat&#039;s are off to Gilles and ACOR.  You saved our lives!]]></description>
