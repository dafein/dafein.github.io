				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Patient centered care has arrived. To many of us this means that physicians should listen to patients in order to match the right subset of the physician’s expertise to the patient’s preferences. This is important, necessary, and insufficient.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What we need is <em>participatory</em> health care, where the patient is an equal participant and collaborator in both health care delivery and scientific research.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.smartpatients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hands-raised-participatory-health-care.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-104" alt="hands-raised-participatory-health-care" src="https://www.smartpatients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hands-raised-participatory-health-care.png" width="920" height="566" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The information age has equipped everyone to become more expert in their disease than previously imaginable. Patients and caregivers can now ask questions and explore options not previously considered, and collaborate with their physicians who are hopefully also equal participants in their care. They can form <a href="http://ronizeiger.com/networks-of-microexperts/">networks of microexperts</a> to find options and breakthroughs faster than ever before, and no one is more motivated than the patient and family to research such options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How might me we achieve a more participatory health care system? Here are three specific suggestions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Patients should co-sign the doctor’s note. The physician (or other clinician) writes a note to document each patient visit. This includes the physician’s understanding of the patient’s story, a summary of the physical exam and other objective findings like test results, and the plan moving forward. A wonderful initiative called <a href="http://www.myopennotes.org/">OpenNotes</a>, spearheaded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, has shown that giving patients easy access to doctor’s notes appears to help them understand their care better. Let’s go further by asking patients to co-sign the doctor’s note. What might happen if we ask the physician AND patient to attest that they understand and agree with the plan?</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Patients should co-sign prescriptions. We can imagine a patient, considering a prescription before signing it, asking more questions about it. Not as an afterthought when picking up the prescription at the pharmacy, but when co-owning the decision to write the prescription with the physician. Hypothesis: medication adherence will increase if patients co-sign their prescriptions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Patients should co-design clinical trials. As Susannah Fox suggests to researchers: <a href="http://susannahfox.com/2014/02/07/put-down-the-clipboard-and-listen/">put down the clipboard and listen</a>. Too often we think of patients as subjects. (Subject: noun &#8212; ˈsəbjəkt/ &#8212; a person or thing that is being discussed, described, or dealt with.) What might happen if we involve patients as co-designers of research studies? Perhaps participatory research is one way to improve today’s <a href="http://www.ciscrp.org/professional/facts_pat.html#7">6% participation rate in clinical trials</a>, even among those with severe chronic illness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s invite everyone to participate and see what we can learn from each other.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">So says physician Emma Hill in her piece called <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(14)70044-0/fulltext">“Smart patients” in the current issue of Lancet Oncology</a>. (Free registration required to see the full text.) Emma asked us if she could join Smart Patients to study how cancer patients are using the Smart Patients online community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are daily witnesses to insightful and moving conversations between patients and caregivers as they help each other learn about their disease and put it into the context of their own experience. Emma’s reaction: “It is incredible to see how a patient recently diagnosed with a very rare cancer can, the same day, communicate with someone else with the same disease.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Smart Patients team has another big goal, in addition to helping patients and caregivers learn from each other. We also want to help them teach the physicians and researchers charged with taking better care of them. The Lancet piece is perhaps a bit bolder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“The new patient revolution is among us. We, the doctors, might think we are the source of all knowledge, but the age-old model of consulting with your family and friends is now global, with a growing membership to share advice. It is not a replacement doctor, far from it, and the moderators are on hand to guide members. It is a reminder that patients are taking power of their disease, and are educating each other through improved international communication. It should humbly remind us that every patient is an expert in their own chosen field, namely themselves and their own life.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">It seems there’s something in the air, at least that being breathed by our friends in the UK &#8212; this week BMJ also published a piece called “<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1209">Towards the patient revolution</a>”.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><a href="https://www.smartpatients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/patients-in-the-air.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" alt="patients-in-the-air" src="https://www.smartpatients.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/patients-in-the-air.png" width="771" height="406" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In their own efforts to partner with patients, BMJ is considering asking authors of research articles to explain how they involved patients in the design of their study. Tyranny of the commons? No, more like tapping into the most underutilized resource in health care.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">It’s an exciting privilege for us to be part of the transition from patients as passive recipients of care and passive participants in clinical trials, to patients as true collaborators.</p>

				<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">A beautiful thing happened yesterday. A young woman posted a short video from her hospital room:</p>
<p><iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/BqFfRiyW07I?start=80" width="560" height="315" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p><span style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;">We hear her saying: respect me. There’s a lot to say about how doctors, patients, and caregivers communicate with each other. Here we just want to share a story about the impact this video has already had. Within hours of it being posted, a physician in Maine named </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://petereliasmd.com">Peter Elias</a><span style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;"> saw the video and showed it to a teenage boy in his office who was recently hospitalized and felt more like a piece of furniture than a patient.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The boy was quiet for a bit and then said, &#8220;She get&#8217;s it.&#8221; The next time he’s admitted, he plans to have this video queued up on his iPad. &#8220;If they want to examine me or draw blood, they&#8217;re gonna have to watch this first.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way in which we’re connected today means this young woman has just empowered this young man in a way that perhaps no one else could have. Thank you, Peter, for helping make this happen, for sharing this story with us, and for getting the family’s permission for us to comment on it here.</p>
