		<p>For a keynote presentation at this week&#8217;s <a href="http://www.iirusa.com/cropartners/welcome-to-CROs.xml">Partnerships in Clinical Trials conference</a>, our co-founder Roni Zeiger asked: what might happen to compliance if patients were asked to co-sign prescriptions?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/patients-cosign-prescriptions.png"><img class=" wp-image-159 aligncenter" alt="patients-cosign-prescriptions" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/04/patients-cosign-prescriptions.png" width="494" height="316" /></a></p>
<p>A thoughtful discussion would be required so that the patient&#8217;s signature means that he or she understands and agrees with the plan.</p>
<p>By analogy, what might happen to patient recruitment into trials if patients co-design trials along with the researchers? We&#8217;re getting involved in more collaborations with researchers to incorporate the patient perspective directly into the design of trials. Will this increase recruitment into trials? We don&#8217;t know, but we&#8217;re betting it will result in science that is more relevant to patients.</p>

		<p>This is a bit of nerdy topic. We&#8217;ve managed to <a href="../../../../../trials.html">make clinical trial search more user friendly</a> by making it feel more like Kayak than clinicaltrials.gov. However, even if you find a trial of interest, it&#8217;s too hard to figure out if you are eligible for it.</p>
<p>Just among current cancer trials, there are over 1,000 ways to indicate the patient must not be pregnant during a trial, and another 1,000 ways to indicate that she must use adequate birth control. We dug into this problem and since the topic keeps on coming up, we thought we&#8217;d publish our little white paper:</p>
<p><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Simplifying-Clinical-Trial-Eligibility-Criteria-Smart-Patients.pdf">Simplifying Clinical Trial Eligibility Criteria &#8211; Smart Patients</a></p>
<p>Fortunately, most eligibility criteria are variants on a small number of patterns. Of the thousands of pregnancy and contraception examples, the meaningful distinctions can be captured in a simple statement that begins with the phrase must not or must. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Must not be pregnant</li>
<li>Must use adequate contraception.</li>
</ul>
<p>Building on this approach we could make trial data easier for people and computers to understand. Feel free to read more in our paper linked above.</p>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p>This Saturday marks the one year anniversary of the very first conversation on Smart Patients. We’re humbled by what we’ve started to build with the amazing people in our community. So far we’ve had over a quarter million visits and over a million page views. But much more important are the stories and how they provide context for learning together.</p>
<p>&#8220;Together we are more, and more effective, than we are separately,&#8221; a <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/02/26/ep.kossove.tribute.leiomyosarcoma/index.html">wise cancer community member</a> said often.</p>
<p>We’ve had the painful loss of too many community members and we think about them every day. The community has also given us countless smiles and laughs. It’s also been special for us to start working with communities outside of cancer, like fibromuscular dysplasia.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to our second year, we hope and expect to see more learning within AND across communities. This idea of &#8220;cross disease learning&#8221; keeps on coming up and we often see topics that transcend traditional disease boundaries. Perhaps patient communities can teach the rest of the health care system how to break down some of the silos that limit learning.</p>
<p>Each of us on the Smart Patients team is more grateful than we can say to be a part of this journey. Thank you for working together with us to advance medicine, one story at a time.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">Like concierge medicine has brought the house call back to the practice of medicine, so will the clinical trial of the not-too-distant future be much more convenient for patients. The stars (and the incentives) have started to align:</p>
<ul>
<li>patients want to travel less, especially if they’re sick</li>
<li>sponsors want to spend less on expensive trial sites, <a href="http://www.ciscrp.org/professional/facts_pat.html#5">half of which enroll one or zero patients</a> into a given study</li>
<li>the era of molecular medicine and targeted therapies means more trials with smaller numbers of patients who are more geographically distributed</li>

		<div class="entry-content">
		<p dir="ltr">Patient centered care has arrived. To many of us this means that physicians should listen to patients in order to match the right subset of the physician’s expertise to the patient’s preferences. This is important, necessary, and insufficient.</p>
<p dir="ltr">What we need is <em>participatory</em> health care, where the patient is an equal participant and collaborator in both health care delivery and scientific research.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hands-raised-participatory-health-care.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-104" alt="hands-raised-participatory-health-care" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/hands-raised-participatory-health-care.png" width="920" height="566" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr">The information age has equipped everyone to become more expert in their disease than previously imaginable. Patients and caregivers can now ask questions and explore options not previously considered, and collaborate with their physicians who are hopefully also equal participants in their care. They can form <a href="http://ronizeiger.com/networks-of-microexperts/">networks of microexperts</a> to find options and breakthroughs faster than ever before, and no one is more motivated than the patient and family to research such options.</p>
<p dir="ltr">How might me we achieve a more participatory health care system? Here are three specific suggestions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">1. Patients should co-sign the doctor’s note. The physician (or other clinician) writes a note to document each patient visit. This includes the physician’s understanding of the patient’s story, a summary of the physical exam and other objective findings like test results, and the plan moving forward. A wonderful initiative called <a href="http://www.myopennotes.org/">OpenNotes</a>, spearheaded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, has shown that giving patients easy access to doctor’s notes appears to help them understand their care better. Let’s go further by asking patients to co-sign the doctor’s note. What might happen if we ask the physician AND patient to attest that they understand and agree with the plan?</p>
<p dir="ltr">2. Patients should co-sign prescriptions. We can imagine a patient, considering a prescription before signing it, asking more questions about it. Not as an afterthought when picking up the prescription at the pharmacy, but when co-owning the decision to write the prescription with the physician. Hypothesis: medication adherence will increase if patients co-sign their prescriptions.</p>
<p dir="ltr">3. Patients should co-design clinical trials. As Susannah Fox suggests to researchers: <a href="http://susannahfox.com/2014/02/07/put-down-the-clipboard-and-listen/">put down the clipboard and listen</a>. Too often we think of patients as subjects. (Subject: noun &#8212; ˈsəbjəkt/ &#8212; a person or thing that is being discussed, described, or dealt with.) What might happen if we involve patients as co-designers of research studies? Perhaps participatory research is one way to improve today’s <a href="http://www.ciscrp.org/professional/facts_pat.html#7">6% participation rate in clinical trials</a>, even among those with severe chronic illness.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Let’s invite everyone to participate and see what we can learn from each other.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">So says physician Emma Hill in her piece called <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanonc/article/PIIS1470-2045(14)70044-0/fulltext">“Smart patients” in the current issue of Lancet Oncology</a>. (Free registration required to see the full text.) Emma asked us if she could join Smart Patients to study how cancer patients are using the Smart Patients online community.</p>
<p dir="ltr">We are daily witnesses to insightful and moving conversations between patients and caregivers as they help each other learn about their disease and put it into the context of their own experience. Emma’s reaction: “It is incredible to see how a patient recently diagnosed with a very rare cancer can, the same day, communicate with someone else with the same disease.”</p>
<p dir="ltr">The Smart Patients team has another big goal, in addition to helping patients and caregivers learn from each other. We also want to help them teach the physicians and researchers charged with taking better care of them. The Lancet piece is perhaps a bit bolder:</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr">“The new patient revolution is among us. We, the doctors, might think we are the source of all knowledge, but the age-old model of consulting with your family and friends is now global, with a growing membership to share advice. It is not a replacement doctor, far from it, and the moderators are on hand to guide members. It is a reminder that patients are taking power of their disease, and are educating each other through improved international communication. It should humbly remind us that every patient is an expert in their own chosen field, namely themselves and their own life.”</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">It seems there’s something in the air, at least that being breathed by our friends in the UK &#8212; this week BMJ also published a piece called “<a href="http://www.bmj.com/content/348/bmj.g1209">Towards the patient revolution</a>”.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;"><a href="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/patients-in-the-air.png"><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-90" alt="patients-in-the-air" src="../../../../wp-content/uploads/2014/02/patients-in-the-air.png" width="771" height="406" /></a></p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">In their own efforts to partner with patients, BMJ is considering asking authors of research articles to explain how they involved patients in the design of their study. Tyranny of the commons? No, more like tapping into the most underutilized resource in health care.</p>
<p dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">It’s an exciting privilege for us to be part of the transition from patients as passive recipients of care and passive participants in clinical trials, to patients as true collaborators.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">A beautiful thing happened yesterday. A young woman posted a short video from her hospital room:</p>

<p><span style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;">We hear her saying: respect me. There’s a lot to say about how doctors, patients, and caregivers communicate with each other. Here we just want to share a story about the impact this video has already had. Within hours of it being posted, a physician in Maine named </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://petereliasmd.com">Peter Elias</a><span style="color: #141412; line-height: 1.5;"> saw the video and showed it to a teenage boy in his office who was recently hospitalized and felt more like a piece of furniture than a patient.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The boy was quiet for a bit and then said, &#8220;She get&#8217;s it.&#8221; The next time he’s admitted, he plans to have this video queued up on his iPad. &#8220;If they want to examine me or draw blood, they&#8217;re gonna have to watch this first.&#8221;</p>
<p dir="ltr">The way in which we’re connected today means this young woman has just empowered this young man in a way that perhaps no one else could have. Thank you, Peter, for helping make this happen, for sharing this story with us, and for getting the family’s permission for us to comment on it here.</p>

		<p dir="ltr">We believe that magic happens at the intersection of stories and science. While big data is important, context is everything. It’s too easy to forget that what really matters is how data and science fit into real people’s lives.</p>
<p dir="ltr"><span style="line-height: 1.5;">This point is driven home by a </span><a style="line-height: 1.5;" href="http://www.esquire.com/features/patient-zero-1213">recent Esquire story</a><span style="line-height: 1.5;"> about a colon cancer patient named Stephanie, a 36 year old Iraq war widow and mother of two. In part it’s a story about applying cutting edge science and computing power to the treatment of Stephanie’s colon cancer. Her genes &#8212; actually the genes of her colon cancer &#8212; were sequenced and compared to huge databases of known sequences of all kinds of cancers.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr">The hope was to find mutations in Stephanie’s colon cancer that aren’t typical of colon cancer, but which have been seen in other cancers and are known to be vulnerable to drugs that aren’t usually used in colon cancer. This approach might uncover a drug that’s “targeted” to the molecular fingerprint of Stephanie’s cancer.</p>
<p dir="ltr">While there were 73 mutations in her colon cancer, none pointed to a better treatment option for her. Now the story &#8212; really, the science &#8212; starts to sound like science fiction. Instead of looking at clinical trials which might offer more hope than the standard of care, her doctors at the Mount Sinai Center for Personalized Cancer Therapeutics built Stephanie a <a href="http://www.bio-itworld.com/2013/12/5/new-cancer-models-part-2-fly-ones-own.html">personalized fruit fly</a>.</p>
<p dir="ltr">They inserted what they think are the most important mutations of Stephanie’s cancer into the genome of the fly. They let that fly reproduce, tested a bunch of approved drugs on it, and found one drug &#8212; that hasn’t been approved for colon cancer &#8212; killed the tumor in the fly.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Rationally, we know why this matters. Stephanie and her daughters now have more hope. The significance became more clear to everyone when Stephanie visited the bioinformatics nerds who had been crunching her data. They were nearly brought to tears by meeting the person behind the data. Stephanie would never have met these doctors if not for her resolve, for the questions she continued to ask about why she had gotten what the internet seems to say is an “old man’s cancer”.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Stephanie’s story is a juxtaposition of what she felt for the first time in her life while on chemo &#8212; the impulse to give up &#8212; and the words on her tattoo: “no pain lasts forever.” When she realized her colon cancer might be genetic, she was driven to learn how this might affect her daughters and what could possibly be done about it.</p>
<p>We are inspired by stories like these and the way they push science even further.</p>

		<p>We are SO grateful for the over $5,000 in contributions we&#8217;ve had so far to the <a href="http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/real-cancer-stories">Real Cancer Stories</a> project.  If you know others who might be interested in supporting, please let them know!  As promised, here is a beautiful video excerpt from our conversation with Bonnie, one of the members of our ovarian cancer community:</p>
<p><iframe src="https://player.vimeo.com/video/75918939" height="365" width="780" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0"></iframe></p>
<p>The full video of Bonnie&#8217;s story will also include her thoughts about transitioning to hospice, about living the end of her life the way she wants, about her hopes and fears.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve also heard from many patients and caregivers who want to share their story, and we&#8217;re humbled.  We&#8217;ve started collecting stories and will be working with our partners at The Story Collider to prepare them for sharing.  If you&#8217;d like your story to be part of the Real Cancer Stories project, send us a note <a href="../../../../../contact.html">here</a>. Thank you!<i><br />
