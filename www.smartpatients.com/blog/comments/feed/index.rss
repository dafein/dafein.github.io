		<description><![CDATA[The Leiomyosarcoma group at ACOR played a front an center role of the early days of Gleevec for GIST.  The LMS group at ACOR was where a number of desperately ill GIST patients heard first word about the small breakthrough trial of STI-571 for GIST (which had until that trial been commonly referred to as GI LMS).   These GIST patients on ACOR&#039;s LMS group became many of the first GIST pts in the world to take STI-571 in what was called the B-2222 trial.  Without any doubt, ACOR&#039;s LMS group saved me from death.  GIST Support International today exists in the open model of ACOR of the late 1990&#039;s.  Our hat&#039;s are off to Gilles and ACOR.  You saved our lives!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Amen!  I am 61 yrs  old and I often feel like the doctors ignore me and don&#039;t tell me everything as if it wouldn&#039;t make a difference.   But it does make a difference to the patient.   Many of us have a much more difficult time not knowing than if they would tell us what they are thinking.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[[&#8230;] I worked at Google until I started seeing that so many of the complex questions people have about their health aren&#8217;t well answered in a document yet &#8212; but those same questions are often discussed in online communities, where a network of microexperts often provides useful feedback. So now, building Smart Patients, I sit at the intersection of stories and science. [&#8230;]]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Ovarian cancer remains SO difficult to diagnosis . As a ten year survivor I still have nightmares about my  hospital stories associated with diagnosis.  But all stories are different . Now a five year breast cancer survivor as well- yes facing the second diagnosis was another story.  I love the tango story but was sad she didn&#039;t &quot;talk&quot; about her experience of hospice care &amp; preparing to die.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[hi Mike, I&#039;m so sorry for your loss. We certainly didn&#039;t mean to suggest that everyone has the same story. Just the opposite: each story is unique and important and can teach us a huge amount. Our hope is to help people who want to share their stories to do so, so that more of us can learn from them.]]></description>
